overview: |
  Configures a GCP environment with basic networking, security,
  and default resource classes that provide a self-service catalog
  for applications to use.
readme: |
  The `GCP Sample Stack` configures the neccesary cloud resources and
  self-service catalog to deploy basic applications like `Wordpress`.

  The managed resources configured by this stack include:
  `Network`, `Subnetwork`, `GlobalAddress`, and `Connection`.

  This stack offers the following resource classes for applications to
  use: `GKEClusterClass`, `CloudSQLInstanceClass`, and
  `CloudMemorystoreInstanceClass`.

  The `GCP Sample Stack` also configures a `Provider` connection resource,
  so the `GCP Provider` can communicate with GCP API.
